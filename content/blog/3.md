Building a modern blog in 2024 requires balancing performance, developer experience, and user experience. After exploring various options, I settled on a stack that prioritizes simplicity and speed.

## The Tech Stack

### Nuxt 3

The foundation of this blog is Nuxt 3, which provides:

- **Server-side rendering** for better SEO and initial load times
- **File-based routing** that makes navigation intuitive
- **Auto-imports** that reduce boilerplate code
- **TypeScript support** out of the box

### Nuxt Content

For content management, Nuxt Content offers:

- **Markdown-based** writing experience
- **Vue components** in markdown (MDC)
- **Automatic navigation** generation
- **Full-text search** capabilities

### UnoCSS

The styling approach uses UnoCSS for:

- **Atomic CSS** that scales efficiently
- **On-demand generation** for smaller bundle sizes
- **Flexible configuration** for custom design systems
- **Great developer experience** with instant feedback

## Design Philosophy

The design follows a content-first approach inspired by technical blogs like Simon Willison's. Key principles include:

1. **Readability first** - Typography and spacing optimized for reading
2. **Minimal distractions** - Clean, uncluttered interface
3. **Fast loading** - Optimized images and minimal JavaScript
4. **Accessible** - Proper semantic HTML and keyboard navigation

## Performance Considerations

Several optimizations ensure fast loading times:

- **Image optimization** with responsive sizing
- **Minimal JavaScript** - only what's necessary
- **Efficient CSS** - atomic classes reduce redundancy
- **Static generation** for blog posts

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- Search functionality
- RSS feed generation
- Comment system integration
- Analytics dashboard

The goal is to maintain simplicity while adding value for both readers and the author.
